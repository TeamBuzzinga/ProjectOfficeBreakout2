Material sounds
Ladders to climb and ramps to walk on

Requirements incomplete:

About game feel I'm not really sure. I've made a halo around the character which is supposed to mean that the character is in some special mode (angry mode or something).
Also in the water pool there is a spray particle effect. However, it doesn't give a great effect.

Outside resources:

Sound files are obtained from www.freesfx.co.uk
Also sound files were trimmed using an online mp3 cutter from mp3cut.net

How to test:

Controls:
Locomotion - WASD
Jump - Space
Crouch - C
Throw ball - Mouse left click/ Left Ctrl
Interaction with objects (Objects interactable are mentioned further in description) - E

1. Start moving in the forward direction of player spawn
2. Climb ramps and then go close to ball and press E. A loud impact thud sound is heard and the ball swings using hinge joints on cylinders arranged hierarchically.
3. Go ahead and climb the ladder and go to edges where jump triggers are present
4. Go further ahead towards the room and press E while standing close to door. The door opens (using hinge joint) with a creaking sound of hinge.
5. After exiting the room go further ahead towards second ladder and jump in the pool. Jumping in water followed by walking on water sound is heard. A particle effect is used to simulate wate splash.
6. One can also push around tables and the tables will tumble.
